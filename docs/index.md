# Welcome to Python PhotoKit's Documentation

Python PhotoKit is a python interface to the Apple [PhotoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit) framework for working with the Photos app on macOS.

This is currently a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use. I'm working on extracting the code from [osxphotos](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos) and adding additional functionality.

It is based on work done for [osxphotos](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos) which provides a command line interface to the Photos app on macOS as well as a python API for working with Photos.

## Source Code

The source code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RhetTbull/photokit).

## Installation

Still a work in progress and not yet ready for normal use. If you'd like to experiment with it, you can install it from GitHub:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RhetTbull/photokit.git
cd photokit
python3 -m pip install flit
flit install
```

or via pip:

```bash
    pip3 install photokit
```
