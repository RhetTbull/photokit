# Developer Notes

These notes are for developers who want to contribute to the project and for me to remember how to do things.

## Building the project

PhotoKit uses [flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to build the project. To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
flit build
```

## Testing

There are currently no tests for PhotoKit.  I'm working on adding tests.

## Publishing to PyPI

PhotoKit is not yet published to PyPI.  When it is, the following command will publish it:

```bash
flit publish
```
