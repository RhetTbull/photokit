# PhotoKit

A python interface to the Apple [PhotoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit) framework for working with the Photos app on macOS.

This is currently a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use.

It is based on work done for [osxphotos](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos) which provides a command line interface to the Photos app on macOS as well as a python API for working with Photos.
